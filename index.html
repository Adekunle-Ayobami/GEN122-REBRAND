              The experience was worth it, my knowledge was extremely broadened.
              Furthermore, the coordinator of the class was very sound and so
              Good, I was able to know things. GEN122, is a Company I can
              recommend to anybody, any day any time.

              It was quite a great experience for me. The training was awesome,
              the lecture was excellent, and the lecturer taught very well. In
              fact one would easily loose track of time due to how interactive
              the sessions were. The internship was also very mind-blowing and I
              gained a lot of experiences. We were allowed inside the theatre
              during operations, and we were opportune to check vitals for
              patients. The nurses were also very helpful and supportive during
              the clinicals.

              really enjoyed the opportunity to learn new skills and improve
              myself. Overall it was amazing experience and I am very grateful
              to the entire GEn122 family. God bless you.
