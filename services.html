          <div class="answer">
            Conflicting, but better to do this if you don't have GCSE in
            English/ University Degree. We hear of those who were exempted from
            IELTS , but our advice is to just do it, to tick the box, just in
            case your form is assessed by an inexperienced officer & they
            refuses the visa on that basis, the decision can be appealed but
            that will add at least another 6+ months to the visa process +
            additional costs.
