          A Certified Nursing Assistant assists patients with daily living and
          provides basic care. Most CNAs work in nursing homes, home health care
          services, and hospitals. They work under the supervision of licensed
          nursing staff, like registered nurses (RNs) or licensed practical
          nurses (LPNs). In many cases, the CNA serves as a patient's main
          caregiver. You may also refer to CNAs as:
        </p>

          <li>Nursing assistants</li>
          <li>Patient care assistants (PCAs)</li>
